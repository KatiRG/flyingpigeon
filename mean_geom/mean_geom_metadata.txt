OpenClimateGIS v1.1.0n Metadata File
  Generated (UTC): 2015-07-29 10:04:33.605462

This is OpenClimateGIS-related metadata. Data-level metadata may be found in the file named: mean_geom_source_metadata.txt

== Potential Header Names with Definitions ==

  ALIAS :: If not assigned, this will be the same as the variable name.
  CALC_ALIAS :: User-supplied name for a calculation.
  CALC_KEY :: The unique key name assigned to a calculation.
  CID :: Unique identifier for a calculation name.
  DAY :: Day extracted from time string.
  DID :: Dataset identifier see *_did.csv file for additional information on dataset
    requests.
  GID :: Geometry identifier assigned by OpenClimateGIS to a dataset geometry. In
    the case of "aggregate=True" this is equivalent to "UGID".
  LEVEL :: Level name.
  LID :: Level identifier unique within a variable.
  MONTH :: Month extracted from time string.
  NAME :: Name of the requested variable.
  TID :: Unique time identifier.
  TIME :: Time string.
  UGID :: User geometry identifier pulled from a provided set of selection
    geometries. Reduces to "1" for the case of no provided geometry.
  URI :: Path to input data at execution time.
  VALUE :: Value associated with a variable or calculation.
  VID :: Unique variable identifier.
  YEAR :: Year extracted from time string.

== Argument Definitions and Content Descriptions ==

* abstraction="None"

Empty returns NOT allowed. If a selection geometry has no intersecting geometries from the target dataset, an exception is raised.

* backend="ocg"
OpenClimateGIS backend used for processing.

* calc=[{'meta_attrs': None, 'name': 'mean', 'func': 'mean', 'kwds': OrderedDict()}]
The following computations were applied:
mean: Compute mean value of the set.

* calc_grouping=('year',)
Temporal aggregation determined by the following group(s): ('year',)

* calc_raw=False
Aggregated values will be used during the calculation.

* calc_sample_size=False
Statistical sample size not calculated.

* callback=None
No callback function provided.

* conform_units_to=None
Units were not conformed.

The following UGID values were used to select from the input geometries: (1169,).

* geom_uid=None
No geometry unique identifier provided.

* headers=None
The following headers were used for file creation: None

* interpolate_spatial_bounds=False
If no bounds are present on the coordinate variables, no attempt will be made to interpolate boundary polygons.

* level_range=None
No level subset.

* melted=False
Flat tabular iteration requested.
