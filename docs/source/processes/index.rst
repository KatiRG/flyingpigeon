WPS Processes
*************

We describe here the WPS processes available in Flyingpigeon. These processes are for the climate impact community.

.. _indices:

ECA simple indices: 
===================

Indices based on one input variable. The indices are executed by an ocgis call of icclim


.. _extremvalues: 

Extremvalues: 
=============

Calculation of retun time Values for 1D time series. 



.. _sdm: 

Species Distribution Model
==========================

Statistical approach to calculate the spatial favorability of climate sensitive species.

The appraoch is to be performed in two steps:

* Statistical training with species presents absense data and historical climate data
* future projection based on the statistical training


.. _vbd: 

Vector borne diseases
=====================

The livecycle of disease transmitting vectors (mosquitos, ticks etc. ) are stronly depending on climatic conditions.

These models are integrated:

* Thommy Model
* Kamil Model

.. _visualisation: 

Visualisation
=============

Line plots using `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ to compare variables of NetCDF files from CORDEX and CMIP5. [..]
