WPS Processes
*************

We describe here the WPS processes available in Flyingpigeon. These processes are for the climate impact community.

.. _visualisation: 

Visualisation
=============

Line plots using `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ to compare variables of NetCDF files from CORDEX and CMIP5. [..]

.. _sdm: 

Species Distribution Model
==========================

Statistical approach to calculate the spatial favorability of climate sensitive species.

:Hint: There is a tutoial chapter to learn how to use the SDM process.

The appraoch is to be performed in two steps:

* Statistical training with species presents absense data and historical climate data
* future projection based on the statistical training


.. _vbd: 

Vector borne diseases
=====================

The livecycle of disease transmitting vectors (mosquitos, ticks etc. ) are stronly depending on climatic conditions.

These models are integrated:

* Thommy Model
* Kamil Model
