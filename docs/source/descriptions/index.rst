Processes in Flyingpigeon
*************************

Flyingpigeon provides processes focussing on climate impact and extrem values. 

.. _extremvalues: 

Extremvalues
-------------

Calculation of retun time Values for 1D time series. 


.. _getEOBS_inCORDEXformat: 

get EOBS Data in CORDEX format
-------------------------------

converts EOBS data files into the CORDEX convetion. (variable names, attributes etc ... )

.. _indices:

ECA simple indices
-------------------

Indices based on one input variable. The indices are executed by an ocgis call of icclim

.. _segetalflora: 

Segetalflora
------------
Calculation of numbers of segetal flora species in Europe. 

.. _sdm: 

Species Distribution Model
--------------------------

Statistical approach to calculate the spatial favorability of climate sensitive species.

The appraoch is to be performed in two steps:

* Statistical training with species presents absense data and historical climate data
* future projection based on the statistical training


.. _vbd: 

Vector borne diseases
---------------------

The livecycle of disease transmitting vectors (mosquitos, ticks etc. ) are stronly depending on climatic conditions.

These models are integrated:

* Thommy Model
* Kamil Model

.. _visualisation: 

Visualisation
-------------

Line plots using `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ to compare variables of NetCDF files from CORDEX and CMIP5. [..]
